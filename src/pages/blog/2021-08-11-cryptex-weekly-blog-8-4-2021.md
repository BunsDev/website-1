## Gemini Now Supports CTX and TCAP

This announcement already made it on the [Gemini website](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-now-supports-cryptex-finance-and-total-crypto-market-cap), and we shared it to the community, but let’s take a quick look at what this means for CTX and TCAP. [Gemini.com](http://Gemini.com) has 46 coins and 66 pairs with a bit over $200 mil in daily trading volume. They’re the 9th biggest exchange by market cap in the world. All of this translates into really great exposure for [cryptex.finance](https://cryptex.finance/), which is what we all want, after all.

You can deposit and custody TCAP and CTX; you can trade CTX for a bunch of fiat currencies too. This is pretty big news for us. Gemini is a solid exchange to be on with a ton of potential lasting power in the industry since they’re well connected with trad finance and obviously within crypto.

We hope to get some events going to drum up support for us on their app.

## **Epoch 2 Completed**

Our first epoch of community grants work and payouts has completed! A HUGE thanks to all community members who chipped in to strengthen Cryptex. The DAO paid $19,450 to 8 contributors, which includes a bonus. The DAO has $5,500 extra for the next two epochs. All funds are denominated in ETH.

These funds are very important for the growth of the project. The more community members come forward with their skills and talents to build upon our mission of providing accurate total market cap price data via TCAP, the better for us all. Those CTX tokens for governance will further help us stay on the right track as circumstances in the market inevitably change. Your input with governance on cryptex helps us do all of this, so stay updated on the [forum](https://forum.cryptex.finance/).

We will improve the way we use coordinape to reward contributors. Help us reward contributors as easily as possible by giving us feedback on this [survey](https://cryptexfinance.typeform.com/to/dyx3VDEi).

## **Community Updates**

Our community is growing! We love to see the numbers keep going up and appreciate all of our community members! We are in the process of revamping the site to show more content, such as a weekly blog. We will also be making a greater effort to get cryptex covered on crypto media.
