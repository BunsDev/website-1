Gaining exposure to the entire cryptocurrency market is difficult. TCAP by Cryptex Finance makes betting on the entire cryptocurrency market super easy. Through the power of our Chainlink Oracle, we were able to create the world’s first Total cryptocurrency market cap token. By holding TCAP, you gain exposure to 100% of the cryptocurrency market. Obtaining and holding TCAP may sound difficult but it doesn’t have to be. This article will outline how to mint and swap TCAP, and how holding TCAP is a great way to diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio.

Before we begin it's important to recognize the importance of TCAP as an asset. TCAP is a fully decentralized, 200% collateralized synthetic asset that tracks the performance of the entire cryptocurrency market cap. TCAP is able to maintain the peg through a decentralized Chainlink price oracle. This decentralized peg means that TCAP will always maintain an accurate price that tracks the entire cryptocurrency market. By purchasing and holding TCAP, you minimize your exposure to the volatility of holding individual cryptocurrencies, while also betting on the entire cryptocurrency market. When the entire cryptocurrency market is up, TCAP gains in price and when the cryptocurrency market experiences a pullback, TCAP falls in price. This article will outline the best and simplest ways to mint or purchase TCAP and have TCAP as a key aspect of your cryptocurrency portfolio.

The first way to obtain TCAP is to mint TCAP. There are currently two ways to mint TCAP. First, you can mint TCAP on the Ethereum mainnet. The second way to mint TCAP is on Optimism. If you are interested in minting TCAP on Optimism please check out: [](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2022-02-12-how-to-mint-tcap-on-optimism/)<https://cryptex.finance/blog/2022-02-12-how-to-mint-tcap-on-optimism/>. This article focuses on minting TCAP on the Ethereum mainnet.

As an ERC-20 token, TCAP can be stored and held on any decentralized wallet. Unlike other index tokens, TCAP doesn’t need to be stored in a specific type of wallet. Additionally, other index tokens charge fees to holders and that decreases your initial investment. This article will highlight how to mint TCAP and why holding TCAP is beneficial.

To mint TCAP please visit [](https://app.cryptex.finance/)<https://app.cryptex.finance/>. There, you will be guided through the process of minting TCAP. First, please connect your wallet. Cryptex Finance is proud to support six types of wallet connections. On our protocol, you can connect your Metamask Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, use WalletConnect, connect your Portis, Fortmatic, and Authereum accounts.

In order to mint TCAP, you must create a vault and ensure your ratio remains over the minimum ratio requirements. Once you approve the transaction in your wallet, you are ready to mint TCAP.

Please ensure you have the correct ratio of collateral to TCAP to ensure that your vault is not liquidated. Once your vault is created, your TCAP is minted and is placed into your wallet. If you are planning to hold TCAP for the long term, it is not necessary to monitor your vault ratio.

**Buying TCAP**

For those interested in buying TCAP rather than minting it, TCAP is available for purchase on SushiSwap.

Once you have confirmed the transaction on your wallet, the transaction will be queued on the network. Once the transaction is confirmed by the network, you will be the proud owner of TCAP. Please do note that TCAP currently trades at a premium from the total market cap peg.

**Why hold TCAP?**

Holding TCAP is by far the simplest and easiest way to gain exposure to the entire cryptocurrency market. As a new asset class, cryptocurrency is still highly volatile. Buying TCAP is like buying Total Stock Market Index Funds such as the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. As institutions continue to increase their exposure to cryptocurrency, TCAP gives broad access regardless of the outcome.

In short, holding any asset whether it's cryptocurrency, real estate or traditional financial equities is risky, however, diversification has long been held as the best way to decrease risk while increasing exposure to large asset types. By holding TCAP you give yourself exposure to one of the largest growing asset types in the world, digital assets. Whether it’s the growing market cap of pegged tokens like USDC or PAXG or the growing popularity of Ethereum competitors like AVAX and FTM, holding TCAP gives you access to the growth of the entire cryptocurrency. No more searching on page 55 of CoinGecko for the next 100x metaverse token. With TCAP, you hold the entire cryptocurrency market in the palm of your hand.
