Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the 14th edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here.](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2022-02-22-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-13-feb-22nd-2022/)

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

## Daily Chart

![TCAP Daily chart](/img/ta-14-1.png)

**Analysis:** First of all, I have kept the three support levels that we have been using for the past few analyses, as they have proven very accurate in the past few weeks. The daily chart looks like it is forming a bear flag overall. The last few weeks' price-action resembles a descending-triangle pattern.



![Descending triangle pattern](/img/descending-triangle-1-2.webp)

![TCAP Daily chart 2](/img/ta-14-2.png)

As you can see, all the signs of a descending triangle are there, from the initial sell-off to the flat bottom at ~$1.5T TCAP and the down-sloping trendline. We can reasonably expect a price breakdown at the end of this pattern. However, there are some essential things to note. The price does not necessarily have to re-touch the bottom in the next few weeks to remain bearish, and it only has to remain within this triangle/wedge and not break out of it for the overall bear-flag pattern to be intact. Thus, we can expect bounces at different levels within this triangle, based on the candlesticks & indicators we use, which we will do next.

## Daily Indicators

![TCAP Daily indicators](/img/ta-14-5.png)

* **MACD:** Bearish cross, yet immediately curling up, not looking to continue, and possibly about to put in another short-term bullish cross. Indicating price will go up.
* **RSI:** Pointing sharply upwards, indicating price will rise from here.
* **OBV:** Also pointing slightly upwards, indicating an increase in buying volume & price.

## Weekly Chart

![TCAP Weekly chart](/img/ta-14-3.png)

**Analysis:** I’ve included the support lines, and the possible descending-triangle scenario onto the weekly chart. Last week’s candlestick resembles an inverted hammer.

Here is an example of an ‘Inverted Hammer’ vs a ‘Shooting Star’ or ‘Hangman’ candlestick:

![Inverted hammer and shooting star](/img/ih.png)

Inverted hammers in downtrends usually foresee a reversal upwards. The same candlestick in an uptrend would signal a reversal downwards. Because we are seeing this candle in a downtrend, we can expect a short-term reversal upwards. I say short-term because the overall trend weight > one candlestick. 

Also, this is a weekly chart, and only with a monthly chart can we deduce a long-term direction. I do not want to be one-sided in my analysis and stuck in one-way thinking. There is ALWAYS the possibility of a break in the trend, and nothing is ever set in stone. That is why I always try to remind everyone that TA is not a crystal ball; it is only the practice of deducing the highest probability of what could happen next, based on past trends.

A possible bullish scenario:

![TCAP Weekly chart 2](/img/ta-14-8.png)

Only when we see this down-sloping trendline broken, can we reasonably deduce that the mid-term downtrend is over and TCAP will rise to the next resistance at ~$2T.

### Weekly Indicators

![TCAP Weekly indicators](/img/ta-14-6.png)

* **MACD:** Curling up for a bullish cross in the coming week or two. However, it remains under resistance and does not seem to have much room to go up. Indicating what we are already thinking of a short-term reversal up to resistance followed by a continuation of the longer-term downtrend.
* **RSI:** Curling up, indicating price will rise from here.
* **OBV:** Pointing sharply upwards, indicating an inflow of buying volume, accompanied by a rise in price. We can also see that the volume the past two weeks has been green overall, yet not reflected in the price, which indicates a divergence that should be corrected upwards.

## Monthly Chart

![TCAP Monthly chart](/img/ta-14-4.png)

**Analysis:** The monthly chart seems to be forming a bearish pennant pattern. I have drawn the lines of the expected pennant in green. Because we are at the bottom of the channel of this pattern, we can expect the price to increase from here as not to break the pattern prematurely.

Here are some examples of a 'Bearish Pennant' pattern:

![Bearing Pennant formation](/img/bearish-pennant-formation.png)

![bearish bullish pennants](/img/pennant-patterns_body_bullishandbearishpennant.png.full.png)

It seems that this pattern needs 1-3 months longer to play out and squeeze in a particular direction. Because the daily and weekly charts were bullish, and again, because we are in the bottom section of this pattern, we can reasonably expect the price to increase, and this would be a good short-term buying opportunity, as there is a high probability of the price increasing to hit the top of the channel again, as well as relative safety being in the bottom of a strong monthly pattern, which hold more weight than daily or weekly patterns.

This pattern represents the battle between buyers & sellers, which continue to push each other up and down and squeeze the price to a single point where one side gives out. Because this battle is happening in the bottom of a downtrend, it automatically gives the bears the upper hand because they are fighting this battle after winning the last few. The bulls are beat-up and have already been burned recently, and they will have less conviction & liquidity to fight. That is the psychology of why this pattern usually leads to a breakdown in price rather than a breakout upwards.

### Monthly Indicators:



![TCAP Monthly indicators](/img/ta-14-7-.png)

* **MACD:** Heading sharply downwards, indicating price will continue lower. It is hard to expect no short-term bumps upwards on the way down, in any case.
* **RSI:** Pointing downwards, indicating price will continue lower.
* **OBV:** Pointing sharply downwards, indicating price will continue lower long-term.

**Final Thoughts:** Short-term is looking positive for the next week or two. Mid-term, we can expect no significant movements and reasonably expect movements to become tighter and shorter. Long-term, there is still an extremely bearish outlook, and the probability of a breakdown to ~$1.1T Total Capitalization is looking very likely.
